The final report will results can be found in the Reports/ folder.

For running the tests in MATLAB, execute the corresponding run_*.m file.

Each dataset has its own run_*.m file which sets up the environment and
starts the tests by executing run_tests() from run_tests.m

A short description of each file follows:

bayes_generator.m       Generates discriminant functions
categorize.m            Categorize a dataset
classify.m              Classify a feature

run_1a.m                Run-file for linearly separable data set
run_1b.m                Run-file for nonlinearly separable data set
run_1c.m                Run-file for overlapping data set
run_2.m                 Run-file for real world data set

run_tests.m             Run tests against given dataset
